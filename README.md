# TouchSelfie
Open Source Photobooth based on the official Raspberry Pi 7" Touchscreen

Starting with a new install of Raspian on your Raspberry Pi 3B or 3B+, run the following commands individually:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-imaging
sudo apt-get install python-gdata
sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk

sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
sudo pip install --upgrade oauth2client

mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/wyolum/TouchSelfie

```
Still on your Raspbian desktop, open Chromium, the pre-loaded, default web browser.
Sign into your Gmail account.
In Settings:
Ensure 2-factor authentication is turned on.
Create a Photo Album. Note: Photo Albums require at least 1 photo.
Create an App Password

Open a new tab in your browser and goto: console.developers.amazon.com
Create a new project.
Create OAuth2 credentials
Download OAuth2 credentials

On your Raspian desktop, open your file manager.
Rename the .json file you just downloaded to OpenSelfie.json
Move OpenSelfie.json to /home/pi/git/TouchSelfie/scripts

In your Raspian terminal, enter:
```
cd /home/pi/git/TouchSelfie/scripts
python ./photobooth_gui.py
```

Enter your gmail address, then enter your app password.
A browser window should pop-up for you to agree.
One authentication is complete, you should receive a long alpha-numeric code to be copied and pasted into the terminal.

The photobooth_gui.py should be full screen now and take a picture automatically.
Click the customize button to set your AlbumID and other parameters.

At parties, run:
```
cd /home/pi/git/TouchSelfie/scripts
python ./photobooth.py
```
to prevent users from changing your parameters.
